If you want to use a partial deck, then you can pass the card codes you want to use using the cards parameter. Separate the card codes with commas, and each card code is a just a two character case-insensitive string:

    The value, one of A (for an ace), 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 0 (for a ten), J (jack), Q (queen), or K (king);
    The suit, one of S (Spades), D (Diamonds), C (Clubs), or H (Hearts).

In this example, we are asking for a deck consisting of all the aces, twos, and kings.
